To test the lab in Python interactive mode you should first do the following imports:

from graph.incidence_matrix_graph import IncidenceMatrixGraph

import algorithms

import main

Then you'll be able to create a graph with a constructor

g = IncidenceMatrixGraph()

And call algorithms by 'algorithms.algorithm_name(args)'.
The same for functions in main module.
To read the details call help(module|class|function).
All of the code in the lab is well documented so help() function will explain everything in details.
